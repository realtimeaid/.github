### Hello there!

We are RealtimeAid.

RealtimeAid is a non-profit enterprise company (limited liability) that helps fund and strengthen projects on the ground. We are here to give needs-based support to grassroots initiatives across a wide range of topics including finance, project management, data collection, reporting, safeguarding, and decision making.

We work with refugee communities and particularly traumatized children and youth using arts, sports, informal education and create safe spaces where there are none. Our mission is to localize aid. We ensure decision-making sits where the need is. The services of the organization grew out of grassroots and community work, with a focus on getting rid of the paperwork for small organizations who are often the immediate responders to local crises.

Our team is diverse, consisting of Arabic speakers, women, as well representative of different ethnic groups and technical skill sets. For more information, please visit [our website](https://realtimeaid.org)
